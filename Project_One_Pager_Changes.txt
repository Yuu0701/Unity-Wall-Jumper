Changes from the original One-Pager document:

How the Character interacts with the Left and Right walls:
    The original idea was that when the character detects that they are in contact with the wall, they will stick to the wall. Instead, the game will now allow the character to perform wall sliding.

Obstacles:
    The original idea talked about adding Monster as an obstacle. That did not happen and the game uses spikes, a sword, and a blue energy ball as obstacles to target the player.

Background music:
    Since background music was discouraged by the professor, the game does not have a background music and some sound effects were unfortunately not implemented in the game.

Camera Control in Unity:
    The original plan was to allow the camera to follow the player's movement based on its current height. However, the camera will now scroll upwards automatically and gradually increases its scrolling speed as the game continues. This change added more challenges and change of pace for the player.
